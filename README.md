# The Organ Grinder's Monkey

By Garry Francis

## Background

There's a carnival in town and your young son has been pestering you to go. You know that if you do, you'll spend all your money on stupid frivolous things, like candy and fairy floss. The household budget can't afford that and you have a mortgage to pay off.

On the flip side, if you don't go, your son will think you're the worst father in the world.

So, you consult the missus. She says, "If you take Tommy to the carnival, then I'll make it worth your while", and gives you a little wink. That's all the incentive you need.

"Tommy!", you shout at the top of your voice. "Get dressed, we're going to the carnival!"

This is a traditional text adventure that was written in 6.5 hours for [PunyComp 2025](https://itch.io/jam/punycomp-2025). The comp ran from 2 November to 1 December 2025, but I didn't start until 10 hours before submissions closed. I started a little before midnight and worked through the night until the sun came up. The game is hosted at [The Organ Grinder's Monkey](https://warrigal.itch.io/organ-grinders-monkey).

## Release notes

Release 1 was compiled with Inform 6 version 6.44 and the PunyInform library version 6.0.2. You may need to make changes if using later versions.
